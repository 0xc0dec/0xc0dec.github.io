To be honest, I had certain difficulties understanding some basic concepts of various things that make up the engine editor. Most importantly, the blueprints. It is indeed a very powerful system, and judging by various tutorials that float around the Internet (including the official ones), this system can do almost anything that you previously needed to write code for."),u.default.createElement(m.default,null,"The main drawback for me, however, was that there’s not much documentation out there that covers HOWTOs for a number of common basic tasks that almost every game developer deals with. The most comprehensive tutorials are represented as videos, so you cannot simply google your problem and get a bunch of links to simple and clear answers. Most of the time it’s watching videos and gathering pieces of information from them.

If you google “unreal engine moving platform” or “unreal engine lift” or whatever similar, you will get a number of links to articles and posts telling you how to make a platform that switches movement direction only when a certain trigger event occurs (for example, the player steps on a button on the floor).

For a platform actor we set up the matinee object that represents movement from point A to point B. When a matinee object triggers its Finished event, the event goes through the FlipFlop operation, which alternates between the two outputs, when executed. When the first output is produced, we call the Reverse function on the matinee. When the second output is produced, we execute the Play function, correspondingly. This causes the matinee to play animation in normal direction first, then reverse the direction when it is first finished, then switch the playback direction back to normal, when it’s finished again, and so on. Easy enough when you know what functions are available to you (like Play and Reverse), and when and how they can be called. The FlipFlop flow control operation also has not very intuitive name, making it difficult to locate it when you’re not sure how the whole process that you need to implement in called."),u.default.createElement(c.default,null))}}]),t}(u.default.Component);t.default=O}});
