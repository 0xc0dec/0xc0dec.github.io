# Hello there, I am Aleksey Fedotov

a full-time software engineer and a hobbyist game developer.

I currently work as a backend engineer designing and supporting Node.js services written in TypeScript and running on AWS.
When not coding I write documentation, plan our work via JIRA tickets, or participate in totally useful meetings.

## Online contacts

I can be found ~terminally online~ here:

[Github](https://github.com/0xc0dec) | [Xwitter](https://x.com/0xc0dec) | [Facebook](https://facebook.com/0xc0dec) | [VK](https://vk.com/0xc0dec)

and probably somewhere else too at `@0xc0dec`.

## Pet projects

As if I don't code enough at work I sometimes do it in my spare time too.
Here are some projects:

- [Solo](https://github.com/0xc0dec/solo), a simple game engine with OpenGL/Vulkan backend, Bullet physics and Lua scripting.
  More or less just a playground for my gamedev experiments.
- [Wireframe shader](./wireframe) for the Unity engine based on geometry shaders.
- [Hardware cursor](http://u3d.as/3eH), a lag-free, OS-rendered custom mouse cursor for the Unity engine.
  Has long been deprecated because this feature was eventually added directly into Unity.
- [Ustats module](https://github.com/0xc0dec/ustats) for the NGINX web server for collecting upstream servers statistics, initially created to be used at my first company.
  Hopelessly outdated at this point.
- [More on Github](https://github.com/0xc0dec).

## Games

I love indie gamedev and occasionally mess around with some ideas. That's how these games came to be:

- [Not so Flat](/nsf)
- [Cubic Roll](/cubic-roll)
- [Line Bound](/line-bound)
- [Uncopy](/uncopy)
- [Ре:бусы](/rebus)

Most of them are amateurish and naive, but hey, at this point that's a history to remember.
