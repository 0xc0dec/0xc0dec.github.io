# Hello there!

I am Aleksey Fedotov, a full-time software engineer and a hobbyist game developer.

I currently work as a backend engineer designing and supporting Node.js services written in TypeScript and running on AWS.
When not coding I write documentation, plan work via JIRA tickets, or participate in totally useful meetings.

In the past I used to develop .NET/C# backend services and frontend React apps, sometimes also touching Python and C.
In my personal projects I lean towards C++ and Rust.

## Pet projects

I sometimes code in in my spare time too. Here are some of the projects:

- [Solo](https://github.com/0xc0dec/solo), a simple game engine with OpenGL/Vulkan backend, Bullet physics and Lua scripting.
  More or less just a playground for my gamedev experiments.
- [Wireframe shader](./wireframe) for the Unity engine based on geometry shaders.
- [Hardware cursor](http://u3d.as/3eH), a lag-free, OS-rendered custom mouse cursor for the Unity engine.
  Has long been deprecated because this feature was eventually added directly into Unity.
- [Ustats module](https://github.com/0xc0dec/ustats) for the NGINX web server for collecting upstream servers statistics, initially created to be used at my first company.
  Hopelessly outdated at this point.
- [More on Github](https://github.com/0xc0dec).

## Games

I love indie gamedev and occasionally mess around with some ideas. That's how these games came to be:

[Not so Flat](/nsf) • [Cubic Roll](/cubic-roll) • [Line Bound](/line-bound) • [Uncopy](/uncopy) • [Ре:бусы](/rebus)

They are all rather amateurish and naive but it's still a history to remember.
