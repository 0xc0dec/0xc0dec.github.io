My name is Aleksey Fedotov, I develop enterprise web apps on my daily job and create games and graphics demos as a hobby.
This is my personal site and blog where I occasionally write on topics Iâ€™m interested in, mostly programming, graphics
or gamedev-related.

If you need to drop me a line or two you can reach me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/0xc0dec),
[Github](http://github.com/0xc0dec) or via *0xc0dec at gmail.com*.
