Hi, my name is Aleksey Fedotov, I code stuff on my daily job and program games and graphics as a hobby. This is my personal site and blog, where I write on topics Iâ€™m interested in, mostly about programming, game development and graphics. My native language is Russian, so posts in Russian can occasionally pop-up here.

If you need to drop me a line or two, you can reach me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/0xc0dec), [Github](http://github.com/0xc0dec) or via email

*0xc0dec [_at_] gmail.com*.
