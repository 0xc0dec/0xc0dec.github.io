The library allows you to change system cursor image and achieve fast and super-responsive custom
in-game cursor which does not depend on game frame rate. Library works with Windows and Mac OS X stand-alone builds,
does NOT require Unity PRO. Can load cursor images from both files and memory (therefore, from assets too).
