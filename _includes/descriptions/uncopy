A puzzle game where your aim is to destroy all movable blocks that fly on the game field.
How? Just place blocks of the same type together, and they will perish! Sounds easy, but you can move blocks only in two directions, and your brain is your only weapon.
Find the best sequence of moves which will make the game field clean, and donâ€™t forget about gravity!
