[Ludum Dare #27](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2013/08/22/welcome-to-ludum-dare-27/) was held in August 23rd-26th, 2013. That was the first LD for me, so I was very excited and actually nervous,
because I was not sure that I was able to do the task in two days. Things got worse when the theme was announced: 10 seconds. I had no idea what game to make.

But I did it. I actually managed to make a complete game in two days, including graphics and music.
Music was the most difficult part because I’ve almost never been doing it before (except two episodic cases that I don’t count).
The bad news for me was that three weeks later (after the voting period ended) my game didn’t make it to the top 100.
Luckily I didn’t expected that to happen, so I wasn’t very upset.

As usual, I used Unity + GIMP + Inkscape, and FL Studio for music.
