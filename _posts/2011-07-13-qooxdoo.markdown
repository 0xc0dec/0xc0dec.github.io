title:  Changing default theme in QooXDoo

The Javascript framework QooXDoo currently offers three standard themes that are shipped by default: Modern, Simple Ð¸ Classic.
Each new project you start is automatically set up to use the first one. To use other theme, you alter all files in the folder
`./source/class/project_name/theme`, where `project_name` is the name you gave to your project. Change the following line:

{% highlight text %}
extend : qx.theme.modern.Appearance
{% endhighlight %}

to

{% highlight text %}
extend : qx.theme.simple.Appearance
{% endhighlight %}

The next `./generate build` command will apply the changes.
