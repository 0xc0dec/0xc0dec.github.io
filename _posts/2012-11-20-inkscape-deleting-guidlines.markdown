It’s really hard to do something with the guidelines in Inkscape, because it’s hard to place the mouse cursor exactly over them.
You should be a sniper to do that fast :) Fortunately, deleting guidelines appeared to be easy: just hold down the `Del` key and
move the cursor over the guideline. As soon as the cursor is over it, the line will be deleted.
